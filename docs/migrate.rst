Migration
=========

Below is a list of caveats when migrating from Bootstrap3/django-bootstrap3 to Bootstrap4/django-bootstrap4.

This document only considers the differences between django-bootstrap3 and django-bootstrap4. For the migration
guide from Bootstrap 3 to 4, please look at the Bootstrap docs, especially the `Migration section <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/migration/>`_.

Icons
-----

Bootstrap 4 does not ship with an icon set, so everything regarding to icons has been removed.

If you need easy access to icons that are compatible with Bootstrap 4, please consider
